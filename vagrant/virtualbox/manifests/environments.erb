# By default Juju ships AWS (default), HP Cloud, OpenStack.
# See https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs for more information

# An environment configuration must always specify at least the following information:
#
# - name (to identify the environment)
# - type (to specify the provider)

# Values in <brackets> below need to be filled in by the user.
# Optional attributes are shown commented out, with
# a sample value or a value in <brackets>.

# The default environment is chosen when an environment is not
# specified using any of the following, in descending order of precedence:
#   -e or --environment command line parameter.
#   JUJU_ENV environment variable.
#   the juju switch command.
